PWAGram is a Progressive Web App (PWA) where users can post selfies or upload images from their device and share them. Users can easily install this web app and use it just like a native application. The main focus of PWAGram is the PWA functionality itself, not design patterns, UI, or UX.

## Features
- **Post Images**: Take a selfie or upload an image from your device and post it.
- **Offline Support**: The app works even without an internet connection using caching strategies.
- **Installable PWA**: Users can install PWAGram on their device for a native-like experience.
- **Background Synchronization**: Ensure posts are uploaded even when the app is offline temporarily.
- **Push Notifications**: Users receive updates and notifications in real-time.
